Featured Imageless Post Detector

Very simple to use, just install and activate the plugin and an extra option will appear in your WordPress Admin Menu on the left side under Posts called "No Featured Image".

Clicking on the "No Featured Image" option will present you with a table of all the posts that do not have a featured image set. It will show you the Post Title, Post Status, Post Author, Post Date and the option to Edit each post.

You will notice that there is also a Dashboard Widget included which will give you a live count of the number of posts without a featured image. You can remove this by unticking the "Posts without Featured Image" under the Screen Options at the top of the WordPress Dashboard. To re-add it, just tick the box again.
